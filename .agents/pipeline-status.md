## Current Stage
STAGE: bootstrap-project
STATUS: not-started

<!--
Valid STAGE values, in order:
  bootstrap-project
  define-concept
  research-spike (only if triggered — see Active Research Questions below)
  generate-agent-team
  build (session-start / auto-memory loop)

Valid STATUS values:
  not-started | in-progress | blocked | complete
-->

## Current Task
<!-- Written by task-loop.md at PLAN, cleared at DONE. Empty = no task
     currently in flight; safe to start a new one or treat IDLE. -->
(none in flight)

## Active Research Questions (BLOCKING generate-agent-team)
<!-- One line per open technical question currently being spiked.
     Remove the line once its research-spike brief is confirmed and the
     item has moved to Decided in AGENTS.md. Empty list = not blocked. -->
- (none)

## Milestone History
<!-- Append one line per completed milestone. Newest at top. -->
- [2026-07-06] Stage 1 core loop added: task-loop + compose-context.
- [2026-07-06] Pipeline commands (session-start, auto-memory, bootstrap-project) ported into `.agents/commands/`; added `scope-check`; removed broken Stop hook.

## Next Action
<!-- Written in plain language by whichever command last ran, so the next
     session (or you, re-reading this cold) knows exactly what to do next. -->
Run `bootstrap-project` on a real target (e.g. FretNotTheory rebuild),
then use `task-loop` for the first real feature to see if PLAN/CRITIQUE
actually earn their keep before building stage 2 (memory redesign).
