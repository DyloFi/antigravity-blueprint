# Project Core Map (AGENTS.md)

> Read this file first, every session. Keep it under 200 lines.

## Project
- Name: [PROJECT NAME]
- One-line description: [PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
- Status: scaffold / in-progress / shipped

## Tech Stack (default — only deviate if the project needs it)
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend/DB/Auth: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend + API routes)
- Package manager: pnpm
- Memory: Mem0 (via MCP, configured globally at ~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json — do not duplicate the key here or in any committed file)

## Directory Conventions
- `/app` — routes and pages (App Router)
- `/components` — shared React components
- `/components/ui` — shadcn/ui primitives (generated, avoid hand-editing)
- `/lib` — utilities, Supabase client, helpers
- `/lib/supabase.ts` — single source of truth for the Supabase client
- `.agents/` — memory system (see below), not app code
- `.agents/core/` — v2 cognitive module contracts (planner, memory,
  context, retrieval, state, reflection, critic, router, orchestration)
- `.agents/schemas/` — portable schemas for future typed memory/state/graph
  records
- `.agents/docs/` — architecture and observability docs for the agent loop
- `.agents/architecture-decisions/` — promoted long-lived decisions
- `.agents/branches/` — optional branch-local memory before merge

## Build & Test Commands
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`

## Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Keep these in `.env.local` (already gitignored). Never commit real keys.

## MCP Servers
Global config lives at `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (not committed —
contains keys/tokens).
- **Active**: mem0 (cross-project memory), sequential-thinking (free,
  local, no credentials — reasoning aid), supabase (queries/manages your
  Supabase project directly instead of manual SQL)
- **Deferred, not added** (add only if a real project's `define-concept`
  run surfaces an actual need, not speculatively): Linear/Notion (task
  tracking — no multi-person collaboration yet), Netlify (deployment — no
  project ready to deploy yet), MongoDB/Pinecone (Supabase already covers
  DB + vector search), Perplexity web-session workaround (explicitly
  avoided — uses unofficial tooling against account terms)

## Agent Guidelines & Anti-Patterns
- Check `.agents/memory-decisions.md` before making architectural changes or
  re-deciding something that was already decided.
- Check `.agents/docs/cognitive-architecture.md` before changing the agent
  loop, memory layout, context rules, routing, critique, or pipeline commands.
- Don't introduce a second UI kit, CSS framework, or state library — this
  project uses Tailwind + shadcn/ui and React state/hooks unless a
  memory-decisions.md entry says otherwise.
- Don't hand-edit generated shadcn components in `/components/ui` — instead
  regenerate or wrap them.
- Update this file or `.agents/memory-decisions.md` whenever a correction is
  made or a new convention is adopted.
- If Mem0 (MCP) is connected, prefer querying it for cross-project patterns
  before asking the user to re-explain something.
- Do not build automated retrieval, graph, or memory-consolidation code until
  the core task-loop has been exercised on a real project and the friction is
  logged. Add contracts first, executable automation second.
- Run `pre-memory-verify` before logging a successful `auto-memory` entry;
  failed verification should be logged as a failed attempt, not success.

## Session Protocol
These now live as real command files in `.agents/commands/` (not global-only
config), so the pipeline is portable across tools, not tied to one machine's
Antigravity setup:
- Start of session: `run session-start` (`.agents/commands/session-start.md`) — reads this file + memory-decisions.md, checks git status, aligns context, and creates `.agents/.session-active` so auto-memory knows this was a real working session.
- End of session: `run auto-memory` (`.agents/commands/auto-memory.md`) — manual only. There is no working Stop-hook trigger — the previous hook-based attempt was confirmed broken and has been removed (see 2026-07-05 and 2026-07-06 memory-decisions.md entries). You must run this yourself before closing the thread. Diffs the session, appends a dated entry to memory-decisions.md, runs `scope-check`, updates this file if a convention changed, syncs to Mem0 if connected.
- Memory compaction: `run compact-memory` (`.agents/commands/compact-memory.md`) — manual only, used when warm memory grows too large or decisions need promotion into `.agents/architecture-decisions/`.
- New project: `run bootstrap-project` (`.agents/commands/bootstrap-project.md`) — copies this template, detects the stack, and fills in this file automatically.
- Mid-session drift check: `run scope-check` (`.agents/commands/scope-check.md`) — runs automatically as the last step of auto-memory; compares the session's diff against Decided/Deferred and flags anything undeclared before it gets logged as settled.
- Casual/chat threads: if you never run `session-start`, no marker exists — brainstorming and quick questions don't get logged as project decisions.

## Full Pipeline (for new/extending scope)
1. `run bootstrap-project` — stack + memory skeleton
2. `run define-concept` — locks core loop into Decided/Deferred/Open below;
   forces a preference-vs-research fork on every open item (see
   `.agents/commands/define-concept.md`)
3. `run research-spike` — only for items marked type: research; one
   question per spike, output is a brief in `.agents/research/`
4. `run generate-agent-team` — gated on zero blocking Open Questions;
   proposes smallest viable agent team, confirmed by you before writing
5. `run session-start` → for each feature/fix, `run task-loop` (PLAN →
   IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → CRITIQUE → REFLECT → STORE, uses `compose-context`
   internally) → `run auto-memory` at session end (which runs
   `scope-check`) — normal working loop
6. Scope grows → back to step 2 for the new increment only

Check `.agents/pipeline-status.md` any time you're unsure what stage this
project is at or what to run next.
